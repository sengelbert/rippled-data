# rippled-data
ðŸ‘·ðŸ‘·ðŸ‘· Work in progress ðŸ‘·ðŸ‘·ðŸ‘·

Simple python project for collecting and analyzing data from rippled. Basically was a project to emulate the XRP Rich-List in Python.

Utilizes [docker-rippled from Wietse Wind](https://github.com/WietseWind/docker-rippled) for testing among other approaches because, well, I could not get any to work consistently except AWS.

## Infrastructure

### Local Docker/Podman
From in the /docker/go/ or /podman/go/ dir run...
1. ```./build```
2. ```./up```
3. ```./status``` (from another terminal window and once completed_ledgers is not empty)

### Local Server (aka running under systemctl)
From in the /server/go/ dir run...
1. ```./build```
2. ```./up```
3. ```./status``` (from another terminal window and once completed_ledgers is not empty)

### AWS
From in the /aws/go/ dir run...
1. ```./up``` (deploys vpc and EC2 instance, including installing rippled service and running it)
2. ```./remote_status``` (to get ledger status)
Jump on the EC2 instance to run other commands, scripts, etc

## Data Collection
Rippled need to have completed_ledgers in the status step above before you can start collecting the data

From in the /src/ dir run...
1. ```python xrpl-rpc-get-ledger-data.py -h s.altnet.rippletest.net -p 51234 -s``` or ```python xrpl-ws-get-ledger-data.py -h s.altnet.rippletest.net -s```
   1. Note: These examples are either RPC or WS with a testnet IP and SSL on. Run ```--help``` for all configuration options
   2. Once complete it writes a data to /data
      1. Ledger details to /data/ledger
      2. Ledger data to /data/ledger-data
   3. Logs, if enabled are written to /log

## Data Analysis
Processing of a full ledger must complete

From in the /src/ dir run...
1. ```python xrpl-ledger-data-analysis.py -l <ledger index>```
   1. Reads data file to perform data analysis
   2. Sample output:
```commandline
